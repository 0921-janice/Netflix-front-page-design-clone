# Netflix Cover Page Clone
This is a static clone of the Netflix cover page built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project is a visual representation of the Netflix landing page but without any functionality. It serves as a practice project for working with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a responsive web page.

## Features
Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts to different screen sizes, due to Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities.<br/>
Visual Elements: Includes Netflix's iconic logo, background images, and mockup text that mimics the original design.<br/>
No Functionality: This project focuses solely on the visual aspects. There are no interactive elements like sign-up forms, video streaming, or navigation.
## Technologies Used
HTML5: The structure of the webpage.<br/>
CSS3: Custom styling for various elements.<br/>
Bootstrap 5: For responsive design and pre-built components like buttons and forms.<br/>
